### Adopt My Cats

- On page load, I should see an input box and a button.
- The input box should prompt me to enter the number of cats I currently have on my site
- I should be able to either click the enter key in the input field or the button on the page to submit my number of cats I have
- I should be able to make a call to: https://random-dogs-api.herokuapp.com/cats/NUMBEROFCATZZZZZ
- Once all the cats come back:
- They should be displayed on my page in card-like style (use Bootstrap columns to aid in this).
- Your card should be a div, it should have a nested div to display the cat image, it should have another nested div to contain all the descriptive elements (each in their own p tag)
- If the cat has 10 toes or less, their p tag that contains their number of toes should have a class of disabled-kitty.
- The input and button originally shown on the page should be hidden.
- A new button should now appear at the top of the page: 'Get Rid Of The Disabled Ones'
- Once I click on the 'Get Rid Of The Disabled Ones' button, any card on my page that has a p tag with the class disabled-kitty should be hidden.
